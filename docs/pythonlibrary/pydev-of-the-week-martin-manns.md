本周，我们欢迎马丁·曼斯成为本周的 PyDev！Martin 是 pyspread 的创始人，py spread 是一个基于 Python 编程语言编写的非传统电子表格应用程序。这是一个非常好的应用程序，你可以自己使用或者从中学习。

让我们花点时间来了解更多关于 Martin 的信息！

你能告诉我们一些关于你自己的情况吗(爱好、教育等)？

我的背景是商业和工业工程。我是德国锡根大学的教授，在那里我担任生产自动化和装配的[职位。](https://protech.mb.uni-siegen.de/fams/en/)

In my spare time, I am enjoying programming, hiking and -if possible again-traveling.

**Why did you start using Python?**

Around 1998/1999 during my studies I was looking for a language, in which I could program faster. Reading the Python tutorial hooked me. Giving it a try, Python has worked for me since then.

**What other programming languages do you know and which is your favorite?**

While I have used quite a few programming languages, I am using Python for 90% of my programming tasks. For performance/memory critical applications I normally employ C/C++. Other languages are mostly task-specific such as the IEC 61131 languages for PLC programming.

**What projects are you working on now?**

Of the research projects that you may be interested in is [MOSIM](https://mosim.eu/). The consortium is creating an open-source framework for making 3rd party human motion models easily available in game engines (e.g. Unity, Unreal, Blender).

**Which Python libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?**

I really like the standard libraries.

**How did the pyspread package come about?**

In one of my previous jobs, I had written a decision support system in Excel. I wished I had something like pyspread back then. Why not just write it yourself?

**What challenges did you face when you were creating pyspread?**

First of all, pyspread was the largest application that I had ever built. The architecture was an issue in the beginning. However, the biggest challenge was the transition to Python 3\. I had been using wxPython, which had no usable Python 3 port for too long. Almost rewriting pyspread using PyQt took years - until November this year, when the first stable release 2.0 for Python 3 came out.

**Thanks for doing the interview, Martin!**
