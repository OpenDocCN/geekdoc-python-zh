本周，我们欢迎托马斯·伍特斯( [@Yhg1s](https://twitter.com/yhg1s) )成为我们本周的 PyDev！Thomas 是 Python 语言的核心开发人员。总的来说，他在开源领域非常活跃，过去曾是 Python 软件基金会的董事。让我们花些时间去更好地了解他吧！

你能告诉我们一些关于你自己的情况吗(爱好、教育等)

I'm a self-taught programmer, a high school dropout, a core CPython developer, and a former PSF Board Director from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I've been playing with computers for a long time, starting when my parents got a Commodore 64 with a couple books on BASIC, when I was 6 or 7\. I learned a lot by just playing around on it. Then in 1994 I discovered the internet, while I was still in high school. This was before the days of the World Wide Web or (most) graphics, but I was sucked in by a programmable MUD, a text-based "adventure" environment, called LambdaMOO. LambdaMOO lets you create your own part of the world by making rooms and objects, and programming their behaviour, in a programming language that was similar to Python (albeit unrelated to it). One thing led to another and I dropped out of high school and got a job at a Dutch ISP (XS4ALL), doing tech support for customers. A year later I moved to the Sysadmin department, where I worked for ten years. I gradually moved from system administration to programming, even before I learned about Python.Besides working with computers I also like playing computer games of all kinds, and non-computer games like board games or card games. I do kickboxing, and I have a bunch of lovely cats, about whom I sometimes tweet. I'm pretty active on IRC as well, and I'm a channel owner of #python on Freenode. I also keep ending up in administration-adjacent situations, like the PSF Board of Directors and the Python Steering Council, not so much because I like it but because I don't mind doing it, I'm apparently not bad at it, and it's important stuff that needs to be done well.

**你为什么开始使用 Python？**

在 XS4ALL 工作时，一个和我一起开发基于 TinyMUX 的 MUD 的朋友知道我更喜欢 LambdaMOO，并提到 Python 很像 MOO 语言，至少在概念上是这样。当时我懂 BASIC、Perl 和 C，但对它们都不是特别满意。对我来说，MOO 语言总是看起来更有逻辑性，更自然。当我最终尝试 Python 时，这是一次令人大开眼界的经历。提醒你一下，这是 1999 年，当时是 Python 1 . 5 . 2；与 Python 3.8 相比，实际上是石器时代。尽管如此，我还是立刻爱上了它。它非常适合我的大脑。我能够轻松地(与当时的技术水平相比)使用 C 库，甚至在 C 程序中嵌入 Python，这是一个额外的收获。我在工作中很少使用 Python，直到我转到 Google，但是我用它做了各种各样的业余编程。

我坚持编程的部分原因是我发现在 CPython 上工作是多么有趣。当时我已经开发了许多不同的 C 代码库，CPython 是迄今为止最干净、可读性最强、最令人愉快的。我从阅读和实现人们要求的小功能中学到了很多。我从 Michael Hudson 那里拿到了一个概念验证补丁，添加了 augmented assignment (+=，*=，等等)，并运行了它，在许多细节上得到了 Guido 本人的指导。这比我预期的要长得多，但最终变成了 PEP 204，并使我成为了一名核心 Python 开发人员。我也及时帮助建立了 Python 软件基金会，这是我们在 2003 年做的，我在前三年是它的董事会成员(后来也是)。

我参与 Python 也意味着我在谷歌得到了一份工作，在阿姆斯特丹远程工作，帮助内部维护 Python。我团队的其他成员在加利福尼亚，我可以定期去看望他们。谷歌的工作复杂多样，挑战性很强，13 年过去了，我仍然不觉得无聊。

**What other programming languages do you know and which is your favorite?** 
I know C intimately, and C++ and Java fairly well. I use all three (along with Python) at my day job. I'm also somewhat familiar with Haskell, D, Objective C, and Perl. I used to use Perl a lot at my previous job, but I never enjoyed it and I don't remember much of it now. My favourite language by far is Python, but C is in a firm second place. I'm familiar enough with its pitfalls that I know when I don't know something, and where to look it up. I'm also under no illusions about its drawbacks, and would be quite happy if everybody moved to more memory-safe languages. Modern C++ -- at least the set of features we're encouraged to use at work -- is also growing on me. The main issue I haveÂ with C++ is that it has so many features you *shouldn't* use. At work we have a lot of tooling to help us make those choices, which greatly improves the C++ experience.

你现在在做什么项目？

我的大部分项目都是谷歌内部的，我们在那里有一个有点不寻常的环境。我的主要项目类似于 Gregory Szorc 的 PyOxidizer，尽管它要老几年，并且与 Google 的构建和部署基础设施紧密耦合。我最感兴趣的开源工作是我用传统的标记-清除 GC 替换 CPython 的引用计数的实验。在过去的一年里，我没有太多的时间来为它编写实际的代码，但我一直在思考，我认为这是 CPython 的一种现实的前进方式。它将允许 Larry Hasting 的 gile cut 发生，而没有太多的额外开销，虽然这将意味着从根本上改变 CPython C API，但我认为我们可以以一种好的方式逐步做到这一点。可能需要十年才能全部完成，但这是值得的。

哪些 Python 库是你最喜欢的(核心或第三方)？

我将不得不无耻地在这里插入谷歌的 pytype。像 mypy 一样，它是一个 PEP-484 类型检查器，但它实际上是推断类型。您不必对任何代码进行注释，它就可以为您的代码生成类型注释(例如，这样您就可以用 mypy 检查代码)。我没有直接参与它的开发，但它是我在谷歌团队的产品之一，我在它的所有阶段都坐在前排。从事这项工作的人非常棒——我团队中的每个人都很棒 pytype 在 Google 的静态分析中发现了很多运行时错误。获得 PEP-484 类型注释的好处而不必弄清楚所有的注释是一个巨大的胜利。

**作为 Python 的核心开发者，你维护语言的哪些部分？** 

I'm one of the people most intimate with the parser and compiler. There's several of us, including Guido, so I wouldn't say I maintain them, though. I'm also very familiar with the C internals of CPython -- how objects and types are implemented -- but again, so are many others. And because I used to be a sysadmin I also involved myself with the build system early on, and some of the modules that deal with OS services (pty, ncurses, readline). Since those modules don't get a lot of attention and require fairly niche knowledge, I guess I maintain those?**Which library is the trickiest to work on and why?** The system-dependent ones, especially ones that have been around for a long time. CPython has been around for a long time, and has in the past supported more operating systems than it does now, at least actively. We used to have support for VMS and DOS as well as various flavours of UNIX that are no longer around. As a consequence, some of the C code is riddled with conditionals that we can no longer test. Often it's to work around a bug or issue that may be fixed in current versions of those OSes, but we have no way to test if that's the case.Also, some of the older modules with (in hindsight) badly designed APIs and middling test coverage. If it's not clear how you should use a module, or the test cases we have don't reflect real usage, it can be very dangerous to make changes to them. Even bugfixes or minor improvements may end up breaking use-cases you didn't realise existed. Because all changes you make can only be fixed (or rolled back) by releasing an entire new Python version, you really want to avoid that. It's one of the reasons modules in the standard library change so little, and why it's often better to use third-party alternatives instead: they can evolve much faster, and they can be rolled back individually.**What's the best part of contributing to open source?**The best part of contributing to open-source is the people. I came into this because I liked the technical challenge, the puzzles, the making things work -- but I stayed because of the people. Back in 1999-2000 it was the python-list and python-dev mailing lists that made me realise this, and in particular people like Guido van Rossum, Tim Peters, and Barry Warsaw. They were (and are) welcoming, friendly, playful, and painfully smart (except Barry, obviously), but they openly shared their knowledge, trying to elevate others as much they could. I've met many, many others who do the same thing, and it's something I try to strive for as well. Diversity, inclusivity, openness, friendliness, it's all very important to me. I would not have stayed involved in the Python community if it hadn't been such a warm, welcoming blanket to wrap yourself into.**Thanks for doing the interview, Thomas!**
