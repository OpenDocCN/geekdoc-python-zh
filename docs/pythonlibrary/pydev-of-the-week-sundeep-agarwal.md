让我们花些时间更好地了解 bunder！

你能告诉我们一些关于你自己的情况吗(爱好、教育等)

你好！我叫桑迪普·阿加瓦尔，来自印度。我获得了电子和通信学士学位，在 ADI 公司(一家半导体公司)工作了六年，现在以写技术书籍为生。我用易懂的例子帮助程序员学习一些棘手的话题，比如正则表达式和 CLI 工具。

我喜欢读小说，最近更喜欢奇幻和科幻小说。我过去经常徒步旅行，但在过去的几年里没有太多机会。

如果我不得不从我的国家选择一样值得注意的东西，那将是我整天听的悠扬的电影音乐。生在北印度，长在南印度，我可以用两种语言欣赏它们！

**你为什么开始使用 Python？**

在 ADI 公司工作时，我熟悉 Linux、Vim 和 Perl(用于脚本和文本处理任务)。我们学院决定为电子专业的学生开设脚本课程，帮助他们为这样的工作做准备。我是举办这种研讨会的团队的一员。2016 年，基于行业趋势，决定从 Perl 转向 Python。在那段时间，我正在学习 Python，所以我决定深入研究这些研讨会，并开始使用 Python 完成我的脚本任务。

哪些 Python 库是你最喜欢的(核心或第三方)？

I'm biased since they are part of my best selling ebook — the built-in "re" and third-party "regex" modules.

Working with "tkinter" was nice too. I hope to try out other GUI frameworks this year.

**What other programming languages do you know and which is your favorite?**

I've had to learn or use several programming languages as part of my education and work — C, C++, Java, MATLAB, Perl and Verilog. But I don't use them anymore and don't remember much either!

I dabbled with Ruby while writing ebooks and understood just enough JavaScript to write a Regular Expressions book.

These days, I primarily use Linux CLI one-liners and Vim for most of my programming tasks. I reach for Python if I need more than a few lines of code, so you could say that's my favorite. Last year I made a few GUI apps using Python and that was a nice experience. Hope to do more such projects this year too.

**How did you decide to start writing technical books?**

The materials I had prepared for college workshops played a role here too! And there were several other factors that led me to try authoring programming books.

I started using GitHub in 2016, attracted by the simplicity of markdown files for presenting programming concepts. I had also been learning and improving my programming skills by [answering questions on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4082052/sundeep?tab=profile). So, by the time I decided to write ebooks in 2018, I had more than two years worth of tutorials. I've published 11 ebooks by now, but I still have materials left for more ebooks!

**What challenges have you had writing the books and how did you overcome them?**

I found it difficult to brace myself for valid criticism, like grammar and cover design. They only made my ebooks better when I tried to incorporate the suggestions, but it isn't easy to face faults in your creative work.

**What projects are you working on now?**

I'm currently writing a [Vim Reference Guide](https://learnbyexample.github.io/vim_reference/) for beginner to intermediate level users.

Aiming to publish the ebook in February.

**Is there anything else you’d like to say?**

Thank you Mike for the opportunity to share my journey here.

Wishing all readers a great year ahead 🙂

**Thanks for doing the interview, Sundeep!**
