本周，我们欢迎丹尼尔·加斯帕成为我们的本周 PyDev！丹尼尔是《掌握 Flask Web 开发》的合著者。如果你想知道丹尼尔还在做什么，你应该看看他的 [GitHub 简介](https://github.com/dpgaspar)。

让我们花些时间来更好地了解丹尼尔吧！

你能告诉我们一些关于你自己的情况吗(爱好、教育等)

我来自葡萄牙，住在里斯本附近，是两个漂亮聪明孩子的丈夫和父亲。

喜欢弹吉他和做音乐。就像用我的原声乐器演奏和唱歌，或者用我的旧挡泥板和破折号创作原创歌曲。

我也喜欢园艺和潜水。

我很小的时候(大约 10 岁)就出于好奇开始编程，用 ASM 或 BASIC 在 ZX 频谱上制作自己的游戏。

我有计算机科学的大学学位。 [Flask-AppBuilder](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder) 的创建者，[Mastering Flask Web Development](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-flask-web-development-second-edition/9781788995405)的合著者，Apache Superset PMC 成员。

自 2013 年以来，我一直是开源爱好者和贡献者。

**你为什么开始使用 Python？**

我在很多自动化过程中使用 Perl，老实说，我讨厌它，python 显然是一门需要学习的新语言。Python 的可读性、灵活性和反射能力给我留下了深刻的印象。

显然，大量可用的软件包使它在很短的时间内变得非常有吸引力和高效。

然后开始用它进行 web 开发，先是用 Django，后来用 Flask。我非常喜欢这种语言在 python 3 中的发展方式，主要是类型注释。

**What other programming languages do you know and which is your favorite?**

In my teens self taught BASIC, Assembler and Pascal. Learned lots of interesting languages in college like C, C++, Smalltalk, Caml, PROLOG.

Professionally worked with VS BASIC, PL/SQL, Java, Perl, Javascript, TypeScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, and even PROLOG for writing alert rules for an IBM system.

Most interesting PROLOG loved the automatic backtracking, but I really enjoy Java, Python and TypeScript.

**What projects are you working on now?**

Currently working at [Preset](http://www.preset.io/), a cloud SaaS for [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) with the creator itself Max Beauchemin as the CEO.

Recently I've been involved in extending Superset to support a multi-tenant configuration, so we are supporting multiple deploys that will serve multiple client contexts in a single-tenant database architecture.

I'm actively working on [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), maintaining [Flask-AppBuilder](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder) and a python elasticsearch SQLAlchemy dialect for Elasticsearch named [elasticsearch-dbapi](https://github.com/preset-io/elasticsearch-dbapi).

**Which Python libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?**

Core, collections, itertools and functools are awesome. 3rd Party obviously Flask (great API), pytest (great fixtures), requests
(really useful) and SQLAlchemy.

**How did you end up writing a book on Flask?**

[Flask-AppBuilder](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder) got a lot of interest, and probably because of it I got the invite.

**Do you have any tips for people who want to get into book or blog writing?**

Writing a book is a lot of work, and a technical book demands lots of detail. I found that having a detailed index with categories, subcategories as well as having side notes for each one of them helped a lot in organizing and collecting ideas.

Focus is very important, I found it easy to get sidetracked into details or de-railing into other subjects.

I also found it useful to set a general tone, writing is not the same as talking obviously, and a book is much longer than a technical paper or Spike. At the very least it will take several months to finish.

You should also take into consideration the technical level the book targets, beginners, intermediate, advanced or a mix.

**Is there anything else you’d like to say?**

Thank you for inviting me, and the great work you have done with the community.

Also would like to say that, It's a blessing to be able to work on something you love to do. It certainly demands continuous learning and you may have to reinvent yourself from time to time. That can be stressful, so, I feel that it's very important to be confident, patient, and embrace change.

Passion and curiosity can drive you to new ideas, the huge and impossible can be split to little chunks. Side projects are great to test out-of-the-box ideas (or just new tech) open-source them please!

**Thanks for doing the interview, Daniel!**
