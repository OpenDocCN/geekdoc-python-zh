本周我们欢迎卓婷何([@卓婷 _ 何](https://twitter.com/cheukting_ho) )成为我们本周的 PyDev。Cheuk 是 EuroPython 和各种 Python sprints 的组织者。你可以在她的[网站](https://cheuk.dev/)上找到更多关于她的成就，或者在 [Github](https://github.com/Cheukting) 上看到她参与的开源项目。

让我们花些时间去更好地了解她吧！

你能告诉我们一些关于你自己的情况吗(爱好、教育等)

我是卓，代词她/她。我的背景是物理研究，但当我从香港搬到伦敦时，我改变了职业，成为了一名数据科学家。现在，我又做了一次改变，成为了一名开发者拥护者。这是我热爱参与技术社区的结果。我最新的爱好是[流式编码教程](https://www.twitch.tv/cheukting_ho)和[用 JAMstack](https://cheuk.dev) 建立网站。

**你为什么开始使用 Python？**

当我在伦敦找到第一份数据科学工作时，我就开始了。我当时用的是 R，但是我的团队用的是 Python。我很快学会了这一点，并从 R 切换到 Python。我爱上了它，从此一去不返。

你还知道哪些编程语言，你最喜欢哪一种？

I recently touched a bit about Ruby and JavaScript due to my hobby (website building), however, I still think Python is the best. It is so beginner-friendly but remains lots of flexibility for more advance users to explore.**What projects are you working on now?**Too many things (LOL). For open-source project, I am maintaining the Python library of TerminusDB - a graph database that stores data like git, I am so glad that I can do open-source in my job and the team is lovely. For the community, I am organizing Pyjamas - a 24hour global Python online conference, the organising team consist of people around the world. I also just started a weekly live stream chatting about Python every Wednesday at 1pm UK time. I may also turn them into a podcast so Pythonistas can have some entertainment during this difficult time. Those are some of the things that I am working on.**Which Python libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?**Pandas and Dateutil, they are so powerful that I used them in every job, from data science projects in a travel agency to financial crime team in a global bank. Even my job now I still use Pandas and Dateutil with TerminusDB to build knowledge graphs.**How did you get involved in organizing tech meetups / conferences?**When I started my data science career, I felt that there are so much to learn and I discovered that there are lots of meetup groups that I can join. Some of them have very lovely communities and I just go to meetups almost every day. I started to become friends with Chiin, the founder of the AI Club of Gender Minorities because of that and she invited me to be her co-organiser. I thought, that's great as I can pick the date of my favourite meetup, so I said yes. And since it never stops - meeting more people and having more friends get me more and more involved in the communities as most organisers are super friendly and welcoming. They are happy to see you grow and become a bigger part of the community.**Is there anything else you’d like to say?**Recently I start mentoring some ladies in the communities. I like the experience, I like bringing out the potentials from these talented people and see them grow. I hope anyone who has some experience in the tech industry will consider take on beginners form the minorities group as their mentee.**Thanks for doing the interview, Cheuk!**
