本周，我们欢迎 Tommy Falgout(@[last cool name](https://twitter.com/lastcoolname/))成为我们本周的 PyDev！汤米在[机器人夹子](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/robo-clippy)项目上工作。你可以通过查看他的[网站](https://www.lastcoolnameleft.com/)来了解他还在做什么。让我们花一些时间来更好地了解汤米！

你能告诉我们一些关于你自己的情况吗(爱好、教育等)

I grew up in the bayous of Louisiana, and while everyone else was interested in 4-wheeling and hunting, I gravitated towards computers and spent hours on my Commodore 64.  Early on, I knew what it meant to be an outcast.As I matured, my hobbies became numerous and varied, but all focused around my passion of building.  For 5 years hosted and competed in Dallas/Fort Worth's annual trebuchet competition: [Slingfest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kacsOd8f__Q), and was even featured on an episode of Dude Perfect on Nickelodeon as a Trebuchet expert (complete with my own IMDB page!).  I also volunteer at a local Makerspace in Plano, TX ([TheLab.ms](http://thelab.ms/)), built a [LEGO Robotic Clippy](https://twitter.com/lastcoolname/status/1141912071820517376) and competed in the Red Bull Soapbox Derby race.  After a few exciting near-misses from bodily harm, I've settled down and recently taken up crochet and hobby electronics.

**你为什么开始使用 Python？**

My first experience with Python was over 15 years ago when I needed to automate ~100 network switches and I had to choose between Python and Perl.  I will admit, I chose Perl because I liked its terseness and didn't like using forced spaces.  Looking back, that was a silly reason as I created really unreadable code and hardly anyone uses Perl anymore. (Except for maybe Larry Wall)My second experience was about 10 years later when working for Yahoo and I wrote their Network Automation Discovery System.  I took my lessons learned from my previous experience and wrote it in Python.

 **你还知道哪些编程语言，你最喜欢哪一种？**

在涉猎 Go、Rust、Erlang 和 Ruby 的同时，我用 C、C++、Java、PHP、Python、Javascript、Typescript、Perl 和 Clojure 编写过产品代码。

Funny enough, my favorite is assembly.  Because I could trust it.  I never wrote anything useful; however, there's a lot less surprises when there's few language primitives.Being realistic my favorite is Python, as it's easy to get started and the community support is strong so there’s modules for almost everything.

你现在在做什么项目？

Outside of work, three main projects are [Robo-Clippy](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/robo-clippy), [LED Lanyard](https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/led-lanyard) and whatever crochet pattern inspires me.  2 of those 3 projects are written in Python, only because I haven't incorporated Python and crochet. Yet.

哪些 Python 库是你最喜欢的(核心或第三方)？

I'm a fan of simple interfaces and few surprises.  When getting started with Python the "request" library really hit that for me because most of my projects start with HTTP API.  I'm also a huge fan of using a REPL.

你写博客的动机是什么？

My mother was a librarian, so information sharing is in my DNA.  Since I love integrating technology, I often hit fringe cases that others haven't hit but will soon enough.  I want to share my findings with the world in hopes of saving others time.I've also been in meetings where the client said that they knew me because of a blog article I've written.  That felt amazing as I had an instant connection with them and the rest of the meeting went extremely smooth because of a background of trust.

我看到你帮助组织了一个创客空间。你是如何进入组织的？

Because I love building and was already organizing a trebuchet competition, it made sense to join forces with [the Plano, TX Makerspace](https://thelab.ms/) and build something together.  It's exciting to work with like-minded builders who aren't afraid to try something new and love bounce ideas off of each other.  If you're not already involved in a local Makerspace, I highly recommend it because they are a great hub of knowledge and experience that you wouldn't get otherwise.  For example, I got up the confidence to build and fly my a drone (Thanks [Pat](https://twitter.com/patsheadcom) and [Brian](https://twitter.com/briancmoses)!).  I've made many friends there that I will never forget.

你对其他想创建 meetup 的开发者有什么建议吗？

If something has sparked a passion in you, the best thing you can do is share it.  So often, we're waiting for someone else to take the reins, but as a programmer you’re are a natural leader. You have an innate ability to create ideas and see them to completion.  Yes it's scary, and yes, you might fail.  But it's worth it.

你还有什么想说的吗？

I've love to share my favorite tech talk, by Rich Hickey: [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/).   His analysis of Simple vs Easy, Hard vs Complex really stuck with me and changed the way I build systems.**Thanks for doing the interview, Tommy!**
