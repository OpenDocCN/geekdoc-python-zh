> 原文：<https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2021/11/24/python-black-friday-cyber-monday-sales-2021/>

Lots of companies do sales on Black Friday, sometimes for the entire week. I am going to link to Black Friday sales for Python-related materials, including my own, in this article.

I am having a sale where you can get **$10** off if you use the following coupon: **black21\.** This coupon works on any of my Python books on [Gumroad](https://app.gumroad.com/driscollis)

This code will work on my newest book, [Automating Excel with Python](https://driscollis.gumroad.com/l/openpyxl). It will also work on older titles like [Pillow: Image Processing with Python](https://gum.co/pypillow) and [Creating GUI Applications with wxPython](https://gum.co/Eogsr) among others.
