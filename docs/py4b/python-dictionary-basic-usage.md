Dictionary 是 Python 中的另一种数据类型。

## 字典概述

```py
 A dictionary maps a set of key to a set of values. 

Dictionaries in Python are also known as hash tables. 

It requires that the keys are unique (within one dictionary), while the values maynot. 

The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an
immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.

Dictionaries are like lists mutable

A dictionary is created with a pair of braces {}. 

For example, dic = {} creates an empty dictionary. 

Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:)

Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial
key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written 
on output. 

The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and
extracting the value given the key.

If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with
that key is forgotten.
