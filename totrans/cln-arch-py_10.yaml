- en: Now that we developed a repository that connects with PostgreSQL we can discuss
    how to properly set up the application to run a production-ready system. This
    part is not strictly related to the clean architecture, but I think it's worth
    completing the example, showing how the system that we designed can end up being
    the core of a real web application.

- en: Clearly, the definition "production-ready" refers to many different configuration
    that ultimately depend on the load and the business requirements of the system.
    As the goal is to show a complete example and not to cover real production requirements
    I will show a solution that uses real external systems like PostgreSQL and Nginx,
    without being too concerned about performances.

    Please remember that the first is an internal Flask variable with two possible

    name that has the final effect of loading a specific configuration object (`ProductionConfig`

    and how we want to connect them. We need a production-ready database and I will
    use Postgres, as I already did during the tests. Then we need to wrap Flask with
    a production HTTP server, and for this job I will use `gunicorn`. Last, we need
    a Web Server to act as load balancer.

    do it, the database will be destroyed once you shut down the container.

    variables come once again from the JSON configuration, and we need to define them
    because the application needs to know how to connect with the database and how
    to run the web framework. The command `gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0 wsgi:app` loads
    the WSGI application we created in `wsgi.py` and runs it in 4 concurrent processes.
    This container is created using `docker/web/Dockerfile.production` which I still
    have to define.
