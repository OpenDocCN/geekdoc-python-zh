- en: In every software project, a great part of the code is dedicated to error management,
    and this code has to be rock solid. Error management is a complex topic, and there
    is always a corner case that we left out, or a condition that we supposed could
    never fail, while it does.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a clean architecture, the main process is the creation of use cases and their
    execution. This is, therefore, the main source of errors, and the use cases layer
    is where we have to implement the error management. Errors can obviously come
    from the domain models layer, but since those models are created by the use cases
    the errors that are not managed by the models themselves automatically become
    errors of the use cases.

- en: Request and responses
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can divide the error management code into two different areas. The first
    one represents and manages **requests**, that is, the input data that reaches
    our use case. The second one covers the way we return results from the use case
    through **responses**, the output data. These two concepts shouldn't be confused
    with HTTP requests and responses, even though there are similarities. We are now
    considering the way data can be passed to and received from use cases, and how
    to manage errors. This has nothing to do with the possible use of this architecture
    to expose an HTTP API.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Request and response objects are an important part of a clean architecture,
    as they transport call parameters, inputs and results from outside the application
    into the use cases layer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: More specifically, requests are objects created from incoming API calls, thus
    they shall deal with things like incorrect values, missing parameters, wrong formats,
    and so on. Responses, on the other hand, have to contain the actual results of
    the API calls, but shall also be able to represent error cases and deliver rich
    information on what happened.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The actual implementation of request and response objects is completely free,
    the clean architecture says nothing about them. The decision on how to pack and
    represent data is up to us.

- en: To start working on possible errors and understand how to manage them, I will
    expand `room_list_use_case` to support filters that can be used to select a subset
    of the `Room` objects in storage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The filters could be, for example, represented by a dictionary that contains
    attributes of the model `Room` and the logic to apply to them. Once we accept
    such a rich structure, we open our use case to all sorts of errors: attributes
    that do not exist in the model, thresholds of the wrong type, filters that make
    the storage layer crash, and so on. All these considerations have to be taken
    into account by the use case.'
