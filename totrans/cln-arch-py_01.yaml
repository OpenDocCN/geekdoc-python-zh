    more than they, and things at a greater distance; not by virtue of any sharpness
    of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried
    high and raised up by their giant size.”* (Bernard of Chartres)'

- en: In 2018 I published my first book, *Clean Architectures in Python*, that was
    born as an extended version of a post that I published on my blog [The Digital
    Cat](https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/). The book was initially created on
    Leanpub with a pay-what-you-want scheme, but eventually I also decided to publish
    it online to make it easier to access and to share.

- en: In the last two years I tried several different toolchains to write the online
    content and eventually ended up using the same system that I use for the blog,
    that is using the [Mau](https://github.com/Project-Mau) markup language together
    with the [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) blog engine.

    blog posts into full featured book, that give me the freedom to discuss a topic
    in depth without the length constraints of the standard blog post.
