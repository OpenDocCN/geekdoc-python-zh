    <blockquote><p>What's the last thing you do remember? Hmm?</p><cite>Alien, 1979</cite></blockquote><p>I will track here changes between releases of the book, following <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>. A change in the <strong>major</strong> number means an incompatible change, that is a big rewrite of the book, also known as 2nd edition, 3rd edition, and so on. A change in the <strong>minor</strong> number means that something important was added to the content, like a new section or chapter. A change in the <strong>patch</strong> number signals minor fixes like typos in the text or the code, rewording of sentences, and so on.</p><p><strong>Current version</strong>: 2.1.2</p><h3 id="version-2.1.2-2022-01-06">Version 2.1.2 (2022-01-06)</h3><ul><li>A fix in the Mau code prevents footnotes clashes in the Markua visitor when merging multiple files</li></ul><h3 id="version-2.1.1-2021-10-19">Version 2.1.1 (2021-10-19)</h3><ul><li>A global review of footnotes and links to adapt them to Mau v2.0</li></ul><h3 id="version-2.1.0-2021-08-20">Version 2.1.0 (2021-08-20)</h3><ul><li>This version is written in Mau but converted into Markua to publish the PDF using Leanpub's processing chain.</li><li>Chapter 8 has been improved with migrations that correctly create the tables in the production database.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ivanovmg">Maxim Ivanov</a> corrected many bugs both in the book and in the code repository, and fixed several inconsistencies between the two.
