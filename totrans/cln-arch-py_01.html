    <p><em>“We are like dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance; not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size.”</em> (Bernard of Chartres)</p><h2 id="about-me">About me</h2><p>My name is Leonardo Giordani. I was born in Italy in 1977, a year that gave to the world also Star Wars, bash, Apple ][, BSD, finger, Zork, Dire Straits, The Police, Rumours, The Silmarillion.</p><p>I'm interested in operating systems and computer languages, photography, fantasy and science fiction, video- and boardgames, guitar playing, climbing, horseback riding, Aikido, light saber combat, rollerskating, drawing, painting, bookbinding, mathematics, and cryptography.</p><p>I programmed in Z80 and x86 Assembly, GW-Basic, Logo, Borland Turbo Pascal, Prolog, C, C++, PHP, Lisp, Ada, Objective-C, bash, Python, Erlang, Clojure, Scala. I'm currently working as an infrastructure engineer for the film industry.</p><h2 id="about-this-site">About this site</h2><p>In 2018 I published my first book, <em>Clean Architectures in Python</em>, that was born as an extended version of a post that I published on my blog <a href="https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/">The Digital Cat</a>. The book was initially created on Leanpub with a pay-what-you-want scheme, but eventually I also decided to publish it online to make it easier to access and to share.</p><p>In the last two years I tried several different toolchains to write the online content and eventually ended up using the same system that I use for the blog, that is using  the <a href="https://github.com/Project-Mau">Mau</a> markup language together with the <a href="https://getpelican.com">Pelican</a> blog engine.</p><p>I have another book in the works, and I hope I will be able to expand some other blog posts into full featured book, that give me the freedom to discuss a topic in depth without the length constraints of the standard blog post.</p><h2 id="license">License</h2><p>The content of this site released under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0).
