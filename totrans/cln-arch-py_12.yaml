- en: I don't want this to sound like an excuse for the many errors that I forgot
    to fix or introduced. I merely want to state that what you read is the product
    of many many hours spent thinking how to explain a certain concept, debating with
    myself if a paragraph should come before another, and to endlessly trying to reconcile
    the code I wrote on the project and the Git commits with what is in the book.
    And since you read it until this point, I want to sincerely thank you for taking
    part in this adventure.

    and messages that people sent me. I'm sorry I didn't manage to put in the book
    everything I wanted or everything you suggested. I have no commitment with an
    editor, but a certain point even a self-published book has to be called done.
    There will be more editions, I hope, so I just postponed the work. In the meanwhile,
    why don't you write a blog post on the clean architecture?
