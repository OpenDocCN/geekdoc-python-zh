*“We are like dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance; not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size.”* (Bernard of Chartres)

## About this site

In 2018 I published my first book, *Clean Architectures in Python*, that was born as an extended version of a post that I published on my blog [The Digital Cat](https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/). The book was initially created on Leanpub with a pay-what-you-want scheme, but eventually I also decided to publish it online to make it easier to access and to share.

In the last two years I tried several different toolchains to write the online content and eventually ended up using the same system that I use for the blog, that is using the [Mau](https://github.com/Project-Mau) markup language together with the [Pelican](https://getpelican.com) blog engine.

I have another book in the works, and I hope I will be able to expand some other blog posts into full featured book, that give me the freedom to discuss a topic in depth without the length constraints of the standard blog post.
