- en: In this chapter, I will go through the creation of an HTTP endpoint for the
    room list use case. An HTTP endpoint is a URL exposed by a Web server that runs
    a specific logic and returns values in a standard format.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will follow the REST recommendation, so the endpoint will return a JSON payload.
    REST is however not part of the clean architecture, which means that you can choose
    to model your URLs and the format of returned data according to whatever scheme
    you prefer.

- en: To expose the HTTP endpoint we need a web server written in Python, and in this
    case, I chose Flask. Flask is a lightweight web server with a modular structure
    that provides just the parts that the user needs. In particular, we will not use
    any database/ORM, since we already implemented our own repository layer.
